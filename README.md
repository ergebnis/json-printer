Provides a JSON printer, allowing for flexible indentation.

## Installation

Run

```sh
$ composer require ergebnis/json-printer
```

## Usage

Let's assume we have a variable `$json` which contains some JSON that is not indented:

```json
{"name":"Andreas MÃ¶ller","emoji":"ðŸ¤“","urls":["https://localheinz.com","https://github.com/localheinz","https://twitter.com/localheinz"]}
```

or indented with 4 spaces:

```json
{
    "name":"Andreas MÃ¶ller",
    "emoji":"ðŸ¤“",
    "urls":[
        "https://localheinz.com",
        "https://github.com/localheinz",
        "https://twitter.com/localheinz"
    ]
}
```

but we want to indent it with 2 spaces (or tabs).

This is where `Ergebnis\Json\Printer\Printer` comes in

```php
use Ergebnis\Json\Printer\Printer;

$printer = new Printer();

$printed = $printer->print(
    $json,
    '  '
);
```

which results in `$printed`:

```json
{
  "name":"Andreas MÃ¶ller",
  "emoji":"ðŸ¤“",
  "urls":[
    "https://localheinz.com",
    "https://github.com/localheinz",
    "https://twitter.com/localheinz"
  ]
}
```

:bulb: Note that this printer is only concerned with normalizing the indentation, no escaping or un-escaping occurs.
